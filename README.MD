# Project Title:  Java Word-Guessing-Game

## Motivation: 
In this project I will build a 'Word-Guessing-Gamet' programme using Java. This will be done in several parts.<br />

## Objectives:
Setup a new project directory named wordGuessingGame.<br />
When the game starts, it will choose a random word from a list of words.<br />
The game will then display the word to guess, with only the first letter visible (e.g H____ for "HOUSE").<br />
The player starts a counter of 10 attempts.<br />
The player will then be prompted to enter a letter they think might be in the word.<br />
If the letter is in the word, the game will display the word to guess, with the new letter visible.<br />
If the letter is not in the word, the game will display the same letters as before, and decrease the counter of remaining attempts.<br />
If the counter of attempts reaches zero, the player loses.<br />
If the player finds all the letters in the word, they win.<br />
